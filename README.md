Git Learning track

- Git Init: This command creates an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one.
- Git Clone: Clones an entire repository from a hosted location to a new directory.
- git add .: the git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. The "." is a way to add ALL of the files in the current directory instead of going one by one.
- git commit: It records the staged changes just added with the git add . command, to the repository. A log message is possible with "-m"
- git revert: This command it's used to reverse the effect of some earlier unpushed commits (usually one at a time). git revert <commit> will create a new commit with the reverted changes.
